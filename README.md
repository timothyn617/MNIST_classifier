# Instructions

Ready to use MNIST image classifier.

1) Run tensorflow_MNIST.py to train a neural network using Tensorflow. Adjust hyperparameters (e.g. number of layers and hidden units) as needed. Model data and tensorboard file saved to an output folder. Accuracy of classifier on the MNIST test dataset outputed.

2) Run test_model.py to restore model and output a batch of test images along with the trained model predictions.
